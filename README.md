Spaceframe_Analysis
===================
This software was developed to simulate tests for the torsional rigidity of the space frame for the formula motorsports team at the University of Waterloo.

The code is written in MATLAB and uses finite element analysis to simulate loads applied on the chassis and the resulting angular displacement.
